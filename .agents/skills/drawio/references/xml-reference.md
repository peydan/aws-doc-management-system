# draw.io XML Reference

Detailed reference for styles, edge routing, containers, layers, tags, metadata, and dark mode. Consult this when generating draw.io XML diagrams.

## Reasoning budget (read this first)

Your job is to declare the **logical structure** of the diagram — what nodes exist, what edges connect them, what labels they carry, what lane/container groups them. draw.io's edge router and (when available) a post-layout pass handle routing and placement; you do **not** need to do layout math.

**Do NOT** in your reasoning:

- Do NOT debate the topic. The user asked for a flowchart / architecture / sequence / etc. — pick one concrete scenario on your first impulse and commit. Never write "Actually, let me think of something else…" or pitch alternatives.
- Do NOT debate flat-lanes vs nested-pools, horizontal vs vertical orientation, one vs multiple variations. Pick the first reasonable option (almost always: flat swimlanes, top-down or left-right based on what fits the content). Do not flip-flop.
- Do NOT compute x/y coordinates in prose. No "column spacings of 160px totaling 1840px width — that's too wide, let me tighten to 1700…" loops. Use the rigid grid below; do the arithmetic in your head and write the XML.
- Do NOT re-derive drawio mechanics (`horizontal=0`, `startSize=110`, nested-lane coordinates). Use the templates below as-is.
- Do NOT enumerate columns ("customer lane columns 0-10, web app 1-7"). Place a node, move on.
- Do NOT add `<Array as="points">` waypoints. Edges are routed automatically.
- Do NOT set `exitX` / `exitY` / `entryX` / `entryY` connection-point overrides unless you have specific geometric intent.
- Do NOT verify, re-check, or adjust coordinates after placing a node.
- Do NOT narrate "building the diagram / finalizing the XML / now let me…". Just emit XML.
- Do NOT write out lists of node positions as planning text. Emit them as `<mxCell>` elements directly.

**Do** in your reasoning:

- Identify the diagram type + actors/stages (1-2 short sentences).
- Identify any grouping (swimlanes? containers? none?).
- Go straight to XML.

**Rigid grid — use for every XML diagram:**

- Column x = `col_index * 180 + 40`  (col 0 = 40, col 1 = 220, col 2 = 400, …)
- Row y = `row_index * 120 + 40`     (row 0 = 40, row 1 = 160, row 2 = 280, …)
- Node size: rectangles `140×60`, diamonds `140×80`, circles `60×60`, documents `120×80`, cylinders `100×70`

Pick a `(col, row)` for each node. Don't think about centers, gaps, or overlap — ELK handles routing between rough positions. Slight misalignment is invisible in the result.

## General principles

- **Use proper draw.io shapes and connectors** — choose the semantically correct shape for each element (e.g., `shape=cylinder3` for databases and tanks, `rhombus` for decisions, `shape=mxgraph.pid2valves.*` for valves in P&IDs). draw.io has extensive shape libraries; prefer domain-appropriate shapes over generic rectangles.
- **Decide whether to search for shapes** — before generating a diagram, decide if it needs domain-specific shapes from draw.io's extended libraries. **Skip `search_shapes`** for standard diagram types that use basic geometric shapes: flowcharts, UML (class, sequence, state, activity), ERD, org charts, mind maps, Venn diagrams, timelines, wireframes, and any diagram using only rectangles, diamonds, circles, cylinders, and arrows. Also skip if the user explicitly asks to use basic/simple shapes or says not to search. **Use `search_shapes`** when the diagram requires industry-specific or branded icons: cloud architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP), network topology (Cisco, rack equipment), P&ID (valves, instruments, vessels), electrical/circuit diagrams, Kubernetes, BPMN with specific task types, or any domain where the user expects realistic/standardized symbols rather than labeled boxes. It also finds brand/product logos and general-purpose pictorial icons (e.g. `react`, `slack`, `shopping cart`, `solar panel`) — returned as ready-to-use `shape=image` styles — so use it too when the user asks for logos or everyday concept icons.
- **Match the language of labels to the user's language** — if the user writes in German, French, Japanese, etc., all diagram labels, titles, and annotations should be in that same language.
- **Group related nodes, and surface a hub when edges converge** — put nodes that belong together inside a container or swimlane, and keep external actors (users, files, third-party systems) outside implementation containers. When many edges converge on one area or cross several groups, route them through a single hub/gateway node (a registry, broker, event log, …) instead of drawing every low-level dependency across the canvas — fewer crossings, clearer contract.
- **Encode secondary detail in node text, not edges** — draw an edge only when the relationship itself carries meaning; push incidental detail into the node label so the connector layer stays readable.

## Common styles

**Rounded rectangle:**
```xml
<mxCell id="2" value="Label" style="rounded=1;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="100" y="100" width="120" height="60" as="geometry"/>
</mxCell>
```

**Diamond (decision):**
```xml
<mxCell id="3" value="Condition?" style="rhombus;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="100" y="200" width="120" height="80" as="geometry"/>
</mxCell>
```

**Arrow (edge):**
```xml
<mxCell id="4" value="" style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;html=1;" edge="1" source="2" target="3" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry"/>
</mxCell>
```

**Labeled arrow:**
```xml
<mxCell id="5" value="Yes" style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;html=1;" edge="1" source="3" target="6" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry"/>
</mxCell>
```

## HTML labels

**Always include `html=1` in the style** when the `value` attribute contains any HTML tags (`<b>`, `<br>`, `<font>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<hr>`, `<p>`, `<table>`, etc.). Without `html=1`, HTML tags are displayed as literal text instead of being rendered.

HTML in attribute values must be **XML-escaped**: `<` → `&lt;`, `>` → `&gt;`, `&` → `&amp;`, `"` → `&quot;`

```xml
<mxCell value="&lt;b&gt;Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Description"
        style="rounded=1;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="100" y="100" width="120" height="60" as="geometry"/>
</mxCell>
```

**Line breaks:** Use `&#xa;` (works with both `html=1` and `html=0`) or `&lt;br&gt;` (requires `html=1`) for line breaks — never use `\n`, which renders as literal backslash-n text instead of a newline.

**Best practice:** Always include `html=1` in every cell style. This ensures labels render correctly whether they contain HTML or plain text — plain text is unaffected by the flag.

**Bold/italic/underline:** Use `fontStyle` in the style string when the entire label should be bold (`fontStyle=1`), italic (`fontStyle=2`), or underline (`fontStyle=4`). Values can be combined via bitwise OR (e.g., `fontStyle=3` = bold+italic). Use HTML tags (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`) only when formatting part of the label (e.g., bold title with normal description). Never combine `fontStyle` with HTML tags for the same effect — this is redundant and causes visible raw tags if `html=1` is missing.

## Edges

**CRITICAL: Every edge `mxCell` must contain a `<mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry" />` child element.** Self-closing edge cells (e.g. `<mxCell ... edge="1" ... />`) are invalid and will not render correctly. Always use the expanded form:
```xml
<mxCell id="e1" edge="1" parent="1" source="a" target="b" style="...">
  <mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>
```

**Don't hand-route edges.** Just declare `source` and `target`. You do **not** need to:
- Add `<mxPoint>` waypoints
- Set `exitX` / `exitY` / `entryX` / `entryY`
- Route around obstacles
- Worry about edge-vertex collisions or parallel edge spacing

draw.io's built-in router is **basic**: it draws each edge as a straight line or a simple right-angle path between `source` and `target`, with **no awareness of other shapes** — a wire will run straight across any box that sits between its endpoints. That's fine when connected nodes have open space between them. When edges would otherwise cross over shapes, or you want consistently clean orthogonal wires that route *around* the boxes, set **`routing: "libavoid"`** on `create_diagram`; for a full re-layout use **`postLayout: "elk"`**.

**What you still choose: the edge style.** The style determines the overall look (orthogonal angles, curves, straight lines) — the router honors the style family.

| Style | Syntax | Best for |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Orthogonal** | `edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle` | Flowcharts, architecture, network diagrams, BPMN — any diagram with right-angle connectors |
| **Straight** | no `edgeStyle` | UML class/sequence diagrams, direct point-to-point connections. For sequence diagram messages use `endSize=6;startSize=6;` to keep arrowheads small |
| **Entity Relation** | `edgeStyle=entityRelationEdgeStyle` | ER diagrams — creates perpendicular stubs at both ends |
| **Curved** | `curved=1` | Mind maps, informal diagrams |
| **Elbow** | `edgeStyle=elbowEdgeStyle;elbow=vertical;` | Rarely needed — `orthogonalEdgeStyle` handles almost all cases; use this only for simple 1-bend linear flows |

**Use a consistent edge style within each diagram.** Pick one based on diagram type and apply it to all edges: ER → `entityRelationEdgeStyle`; UML class → straight; mind maps → curved; flowcharts/architecture/network → `orthogonalEdgeStyle`.

**Useful edge style attributes** that apply regardless of routing:
- `rounded=1` — rounded corners at bend points (recommended for orthogonal)
- `endArrow=classic` / `endArrow=none` — arrow heads
- `dashed=1` — dashed line
- `strokeColor=#...`, `strokeWidth=2` — color/width
